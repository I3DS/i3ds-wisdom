# i3ds-wisdom

I3DS interface for the WISODM GPR. The project creates two executables: 

* **i3ds\_wisdom** which creates a sensor node that accepts I3DS commands and sends UDP messages to the WISDOM server.
* **wisdom\_ack\_service** which listenes for UDP messages and sends an ACK after a given time interval.

## Building

First, install **i3ds-framework-cpp** and all its dependencies. Then, from the project root folder:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

The executables can then be installed with

```bash
sudo make install
```

or just run from the build folder.

## Testing
There are two ways to test the **i3ds_wisdom** program without an actual WISDOM GPR: 

1. Running **i3ds\_wisdom** in dummy mode
2. Running **i3ds\_wisdom** together with **wisdom\_ack\_service** 

### Running **i3ds\_wisdom** in dummy mode
When **Ã¬3ds\_wisdom** is run in dummy mode, it will not send any UDP packets. Instead it will print messages to the console and automatically change its own state when it receives a command. When a *start* command is sent, it will go to the *operational* state and wait for a configured number of seconds before it returns to the *standby* state. To run **i3ds\_wisdom** in dummy mode, run it with the `-d` flag and a number greater than 0, which will be the duration it will wait while "taking a measurement". To run the service with node number 25 and a measurement delay of 5 seconds:

```bash
i3ds_wisdom -n 25 -d 5
```

We can then activate and start the sensor from another terminal with the commands

```bash
i3ds_configure_wisdom -n 25 --activate
```

We can choose which tables will be used during the measurement. To use tables 1 and 3, run:

```bash
i3ds_configure_wisdom -n 25 --set-tables 1 0 1 0
```
Then we can start the measurement with:

```bash
i3ds_configure_wisdom -n 25 --start
```

Then we can see the **i3ds\_wisdom** instance print its status messages. We can also query the state of the sensor from the other terminal with

```bash
i3ds_configure_sensor -n 25 --print
```

This will show that the WISDOM sensor transitions between the *standby* and *operational* states.

### Running i3ds\_wisdom together with wisdom\_ack\_service
This setup runs the **i3ds\_wisdom** node as if it was communicating with the real WISDOM server, and uses the **wisdom\_ack\_service** to listen for UDP messages and send ACK messages back after a configured delay.

> ***WARNING*** The **wisdom\_ack\_service** is only made to test the UDP functionality. It does not aim to be an accurate representation of how the actual WISDOM server works.

Run the **wisdom\_ack\_service** with a chosen port with

```bash
wisdom_ack_service -p 12345
```

and in another terminal, run the **i3ds\_wisdom** service with

```bash
i3ds_wisdom -n 25 -p 12345
```

This time, we run it with the `-p` flag and a port number instead of the `-d` flag. It will now send actual UDP messages to the chosen port number on the local machine and wait for an ACK message. *Note: It does not currently check what the ACK message contains, just that it receives one.* Then we can send commands using **i3ds\_configure\_sensor** like before.

## Run with a real GPR
To run the system with a real WISDOM GPR, just run the **i3ds\_wisdom** service:

```bash
i3ds_wisdom -n <node> -p <port> -s <serial_device>
```

using a chosen node ID and the port of the WISDOM server. The `<serial_device>` is the file name for the serial port to the power control. If this if omitted, no serial commands are sent, and the power must be controlled manually. If the server is running on another machine, use

```bash
i3ds_wisdom -n <node> -p <port> -i <ip-address>
```

When the real sensor is used, the interface will send power-on commands during activation. The command is the same as in dummy mode:

```bash
i3ds_configure_wisdom -n 25 --activate
```

The interface will also send commands to the GPR to set the time and load parameter tables. These commands can also be triggered manually after activation with:

```bash
i3ds_configure_wisdom -n 25 --set-time
i3ds_configure_wisdom -n 25 --load-tables
```

Setting which tables to use is also the same as in dummy mode.
